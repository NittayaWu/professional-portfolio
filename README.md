# professional-portfolio

## Description

This project is a professional portolio to show potential employers of work I have done. It is ongoing application in which I will continually add upon throughout bootcamp and my career with new projects and skills aquired. This portfolio was created using HTML and CSS. 

This site includes three sections: About Me, Work, and Contact. Functioning links in the navigation bar will take the user to any of these three sections. The 'About Me' section has my profile photo and a paragraph of my work experience. The projects within the 'Work' section include a couple of sample applications I have worked on for the bootcamp as well as some placeholder applications that will be added to as I complete more projects in my bootcamp course and throughout my career. When you hover over an application in the "Work" section, that application will grow larger in size than the others. When the user clicks on the first application in the "Work" section, it will take them to the deployed application on my GitHub account. 
The 'Contact' section in the footer navigation bar contains links to my personal email, GitHub, and Lindin accounts. When the user resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices, then they are resented with a responsive layout that adapts to their viewport.
