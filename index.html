        <h2> About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Nittaya and I'm a University of Connecticut class of 2003 alumni with a background in Genetic Sciences. I spent many years working in labs including at Bayer Pharmaceutical and  Yale University School of Medicine DNA Lab as an intern, Dianon Systems as molecular technologist and at Lonza Biologics as a QC analyst. In 2008, I moved to Taiwan as a trailing spouse and became a full time stay at home mom. While in Taiwan,I took courses to learn Mandarin Chinese and immersed myself in the culture to become fully fluent in the language. In 2022 I relocated back to the US and decided instead of going back working in a lab, to learn a new skill to be able to re-enter the workforce. I am currently enrolled in the Full Stack Coding Bootcamp through the University of Connecticul School of Engineering in partnership with edX. I hope to find a new career as a coder that can combine with my past work experience in molecular science. In my free time I enjoy running, hike and cycling with my family.
